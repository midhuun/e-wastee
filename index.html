			<h2>Data Degaussing How it Works</h2>
			<div class="content">
				<p>An alternating current (AC) bulk eraser (degausser) is used for the complete erasure of data and other signals on magnetic media. Degaussing is a process where magnetic media is exposed to a powerful, alternating magnetic field. Degaussing removes previously written data, leaving the media in a magnetically randomized (blank) state. <br>
					Field data of the erasure process including timestamps, voltage, and field strength are recorded for certification and audit purposes, and a copy is issued to the client. We use a 12,000 Oe magnetic flux capable degausser to destroy the data on the tapes which have typical coercivity values of 300-2700 Oe. This is typically 6X times the magnetic coercivity of the tape media used normally.</p>
